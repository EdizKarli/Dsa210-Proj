# My Existential Crisis
## PROJECT IDEA and MOTIVATION

In this project my aim is to analyze the frequency of my existential crises and how various factors throughout the day influence it. The goal is to understand whether there is a real relation between these thoughts and my regular daily routine or if they occur regardless of what I do. By analyzing factors such as school attendance, exam and project schedules, travel time, sleep time and quality, amount of social interaction I had in a day and checking if I was thinking about this particular project before or after having one of those thoughts, I hope to uncover patterns that could help me understand or not understand the root of these existential thoughts. Ultimately, the objective is to try and see if there is a connection between the thought of "Why am I doing this?" and what I am doing while thinking it. 

##  DATASET DESCRIPTION 
- **Date** : Data entry day
- **School Attendance**: YES or NO, will be marked by me.
- **Amount of Time In School**: In terms of hours, I will be using Google Maps to check how many hourse I stayed in school.
- **Travel Time**: In terms of minutes or hours, will be using Google Maps to check it. 
- **Sleep Time**: In terms of hours, will be using a smartwatch to collect the data.
- **Sleep Quality**: 1-10, I will be using the same smartwatch and same app to collect the data.
- **Social Interaction**: In terms of numbers, it will start with 0 and with every non-family member who I talk more than 3 minutes I will add one to it.
- **Did I Think About It**: YES or NO, checking if I thought about this project that day. (excluding data entry times etc.)
- **Existential Crises**: From 0 to infinity, will be marked by me.

# DATA COLLECTION
- Data will be collected for 35 days. (10th March to 13th April)
- Sources:
    - Smartwatch application for sleep time and quality
    - Google Maps for school time and travel time
    - Myself for others
- To ensure consistency and minimize bias:
    - Information will be recorded daily
    - Data will be systematically organized and accessible.
    - Confounding variables and outliers will be carefully considered to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
    - I will try not to think about it too much.

#### **Data Preparation and Analysis** 
- At the end of the data collection period: 
	- Data will be reviewed for completeness and consistency. 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
	- Trends will be identified using statistical methods and visualization techniques. 
- **Regression Analysis:** 
	- Statistical methods will be applied to investigate the impact of various factors such as departure time and weather on travel duration and stress levels.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that existential crises are more frequent on days with:
- Less sleep and lower sleep quality
- More stressful academic events, such as exams and project deadlines.
- Lower social interaction, which could correlate with increased self-reflection.

## Expected Outcome
Insights: I expect to uncover patterns that link existential crises with certain daily events or routines, such as lack of sleep, high stress, or looming deadlines
## Expected Visualizations
-Time-Series Plots: To track existential crises over time and look for trends.
-Correlation Heatmaps: To see how different factors relate to existential crises.
-Regression Models: To quantify how much each factor contributes to crisis frequency
